Hotel Booking App README
Welcome to the Hotel Booking App! This is a user-friendly web application built with Python and Streamlit that allows you to search for hotels, book them, and simulate a payment process—all without any real transactions. It’s perfect for learning or testing a hotel booking system. This README is designed for someone with minimal coding knowledge to set up and run the app on their PC using a GitHub repository.

What This App Does
Search Hotels: Look for hotels in any city (e.g., Faridabad) using real data from the SerpAPI Google Hotels API.
Book a Hotel: Select a hotel, specify the number of people and rooms, and proceed to a booking summary.
Simulate Payment: Enter fake payment details to mimic a real payment process (nothing is actually charged).
Chat with a Bot: Use a chatbot to help with booking or answer travel-related questions.
View Bookings: See a list of your past bookings.
Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have the following on your computer:

A Computer: Windows, macOS, or Linux will work.
Internet Connection: To download the code and dependencies.
GitHub Account: To access the repository (optional if you download the ZIP file).
API Keys:
A SerpAPI Key for hotel search data.
A Groq API Key for the chatbot feature.
Step-by-Step Setup Guide
Step 1: Install Required Software
You need to install a few tools to run the app. Don’t worry, I’ll guide you through each one.

1.1 Install Python
Check if Python is Installed:
Open a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux).
Type python --version and press Enter.
If you see a version number (e.g., Python 3.9.0), Python is installed. Skip to Step 1.2.
If not, you need to install Python.
Install Python:
Go to python.org.
Download the latest version (e.g., Python 3.11).
Run the installer:
On Windows: Check the box “Add Python to PATH” during installation.
On macOS/Linux: The installer will handle everything.
After installation, open a terminal again and type python --version to confirm.
1.2 Install Git (Optional)
Git helps you download the code from GitHub.

Check if Git is Installed:
In your terminal, type git --version.
If you see a version number (e.g., git version 2.30.0), Git is installed. Skip to Step 2.
Install Git:
Go to git-scm.com.
Download and install Git for your operating system.
Follow the default installation settings.
1.3 Install a Code Editor (Optional but Recommended)
A code editor like Visual Studio Code (VS Code) makes it easier to manage files.

Download VS Code from code.visualstudio.com.
Install it and open it (you’ll use it in Step 3).
Step 2: Get the Code from GitHub
The code is hosted in a GitHub repository. Here’s how to get it:

Option 1: Clone the Repository (Using Git)
Open your terminal.
Navigate to a folder where you want to store the project:
On Windows: cd Documents
On macOS/Linux: cd ~
Run this command to clone the repository (replace REPO_URL with the actual GitHub repository URL):
text

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
git clone REPO_URL
Example: git clone https://github.com/username/hotel-booking-app.git
Move into the project folder:
text

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
cd hotel-booking-app
Option 2: Download as ZIP
Go to the GitHub repository page in your browser.
Click the green Code button and select Download ZIP.
Extract the ZIP file to a folder on your computer (e.g., Documents/hotel-booking-app).
Open the folder in your file explorer.
Step 3: Set Up API Keys
The app needs two API keys to work: one for SerpAPI (hotel search) and one for Groq (chatbot).

3.1 Get a SerpAPI Key
Go to serpapi.com.
Sign up for a free account (they offer a free plan with limited searches).
After signing in, go to your dashboard.
Copy your API Key (it looks like a long string of letters and numbers).
3.2 Get a Groq API Key
Go to groq.com.
Sign up for an account.
Once logged in, find your API key in your account settings or dashboard.
Copy your API Key.
3.3 Create a .env File
Open the project folder (hotel-booking-app) in your file explorer or VS Code.
Create a new file named .env (make sure it has no extension like .txt).
On Windows: Right-click in the folder, select New > Text Document, name it .env, and remove the .txt extension.
On macOS/Linux: In the terminal, run touch .env.
Open the .env file in a text editor (like Notepad or VS Code).
Add the following lines, replacing your_serpapi_key and your_groq_api_key with the keys you copied:
text

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
SERPAPI_KEY=your_serpapi_key
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
Example:
text

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
SERPAPI_KEY=abc123def456ghi789
GROQ_API_KEY=xyz987pqr654stu321
Save the file.
Step 4: Install Dependencies
The app needs some Python libraries to run. We’ll install them using pip, which comes with Python.

Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder:
text

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
cd path/to/hotel-booking-app
Example: cd Documents/hotel-booking-app
Install the required libraries by running this command:
text

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
pip install streamlit sqlite3 requests python-dotenv pandas groq
This might take a few minutes.
If you get an error like pip is not recognized, ensure Python was added to your PATH (reinstall Python and check the “Add Python to PATH” box).
Step 5: Run the App
Now you’re ready to run the app!

In the terminal, make sure you’re in the project folder (hotel-booking-app).
Run the following command to start the app:
text

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
streamlit run app.py
Replace app.py with the name of the Python file containing the code (it’s usually app.py or main.py—check the repository).
Example: streamlit run app.py
Your default web browser should automatically open, and you’ll see the app running at http://localhost:8501.
If it doesn’t open, copy the URL from the terminal (usually http://localhost:8501) and paste it into your browser.
